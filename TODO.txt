- create the loading scene:
-- start button begins the first game

- GameScene needs to know what bricks to load for that stage
-- some kind of game manager to track stages to know what to build for next stage

Things to track:
- current stage / total number of stages cleared (same thing - 1) 
- balls remaining
- paddle mods, ball mods, brick mods 
- getRewards() - returns three reward choices (takes into account current modes and stage)
- count of bricks hit with current ball
